TITLE: Linux upskill challenge starting 

The http://linuxupskillchallenge.org Linux commandline/sysadmin "challenge" course starts again soon on the first Monday of next month.

Does require some commitment - but if gaining/growing these skills is important to you, then you now have no excuse! 

Requires a (free or cheap) remote server, so it's nice to get that sorted now if you are keen - but you can use a local isolated VM, no problem.

The course is free, and daily lessons appear in the sub-reddit r/linuxupskillchallenge - which is used for support/discussion. A [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/wd4Zqyk) is also available.

More details at our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/comments/qeymzb/please_read_this_first_how_this_works_faq/).

Any feedback is very welcomed.
