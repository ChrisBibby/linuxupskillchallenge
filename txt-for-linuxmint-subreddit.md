TITLE: Month-long Mint commandline/sysadmin course starting 

This course restarts the first Monday of next month. Based around Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, it's just as applicable for Linux Mint users.

The course is free, and daily lessons appear in the sub-reddit r/linuxupskillchallenge - which is also used for support/discussion.

Any feedback very welcome.
