TITLE: Month-long commandline/sysadmin course starting 

This course restarts the first Monday of next month. Based around Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, but it is still very much applicable to Debian.

The course is free, and daily lessons appear in the sub-reddit r/linuxupskillchallenge - which is used for support/discussion. A [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/wd4Zqyk) is also available.

More details at our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/comments/qeymzb/please_read_this_first_how_this_works_faq/).

Any feedback is very welcomed.
