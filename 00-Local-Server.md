# Day 0 - Creating Your Own Local Server

**READ THIS FIRST!** [HOW THIS WORKS & FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/comments/qeymzb/please_read_this_first_how_this_works_faq/)

## It's difficult to create a server in cloud without a credit card

We normally recommend using Amazon's AWS "Free Tier" (<http://aws.amazon.com>) or Digital Ocean (<https://digitalocean.com>) - but both require that you have a credit card. The same is true of the Microsoft Azure, Google's GCP and the vast majority of providers listed at Low End Box (<https://lowendbox.com/>).

Some will accept PayPal, or Bitcoin - but typically those who don't have a credit card don't have these either.

**WARNING:** If you go searching too deeply for options in this area, you're very likely to come across a range of scammy, fake, or fraudulent sites. While we've tried to eliminate these from the links below, please do be careful! It should go without saying that none of these are "affiliate" links, and we get no kick-backs from any of them :-)

## But what if I donâ€™t want to use a cloud provider? You can just work with a local virtual machine

You can run the challenge on a home server and all the commands will work as they would on a cloud server. However, not being exposed to the wild certainly loses the feel of what real sysadmins have to face.

If you set your own VM at a private server, go for the minimum requirements like 1GHz CPU core, 512MB RAM, and a couple of gigs of disk space. You can always adapt this to your heart's desire (or how much hardware you have available).

Our recommendation is: use a cloud server if you can, to get the full experience, but don't get limited by it. **This is your server.**

*NOTE:* By popular demand, we are currently working on tutorials that cover non-cloud server options.
