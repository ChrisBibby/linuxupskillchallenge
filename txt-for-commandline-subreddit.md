TITLE: Free Linux commandline "upskill" course starting 

This free month-long course is re-starting again on the first Monday of next month.

As you'll see, it's aimed at those wanting to admin servers, but 100% of the content is classic Linux commandline stuff just as applicable to a desktop user.

The course is free, and daily lessons appear in the sub-reddit r/linuxupskillchallenge - which is used for support/discussion. A [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/wd4Zqyk) is also available.

More details at our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/comments/qeymzb/please_read_this_first_how_this_works_faq/).

Any feedback is very welcomed.
