TITLE: Linux commandline/sysadmin course starting 

Daily lessons appear in  the sub-reddit /r/linuxupskillchallenge  - which is also used for support/discussion. This is a 'rolling' course repeated each month. Announcing now to give you plenty of time to set up your server if you want to participate.  More detail at: http://linuxupskillchallenge.org 

Any feedback very welcome.
