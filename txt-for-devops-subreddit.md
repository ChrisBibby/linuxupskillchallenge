TITLE: Free intro to Linux commandline/server course starting 

This free month-long course is re-starting again on the first Monday of next month.

This course has been running successfully now every month since February 2020 - more detail at: https://LinuxUpskillChallenge.org - daily lessons appear in the sub-reddit r/linuxupskillchallenge - which is also used for support/discussion.

Suitable whatever your background, and aims to provide that "base layer" of traditional Linux skills in a fun interactive way.

Any feedback very welcome.
